# Todo

+ IMPORTANT: 
    + kvm qxl does not work (kernel faults) on suspend and hibernate, use virtio vga instead
    + virtio vga does not work in X11, use qxl instead

## testing

+ frankenstein support (custom zfs-linux)
  + compiled packages must also get written in recovery.squashfs so cloud-init will install the custom packages next time

## working on

+ overlayfs compatible backport build of spl-linux and zfs-linux
  + add spl-dkms, zfs-dkms to cloud-init pkg install and other packages list
  + check if need to remake dracut initrd after patching
  + add exact dependency from zfs-linux to zfs-dkms zfs-dkms*

+ /var/log unmounting
```
var-log.mount: Mount process exited, code=exited status=32
M채r 01 00:03:18 box systemd[1]: Failed unmounting /var/log.
M채r 01 00:03:22 box systemd-cryptsetup[2952]: Failed to deactivate: Device or resource busy

## features to add/finish, known issues to fix

### recovery, install/restore stages
+ FIXME: overlayfs compatible backport build of spl-linux and zfs-linux
+ FIXME: /var/log unmounting
+ FIXME: --recovery-autologin
+ FIXME: default.plymouth.grub
+ FIXME: grub failsafe writing: does timeout different (25 seconds) but does not pre select recovery
+ FIXME: make "grub-reboot <entry>" working also on mdadm boot by using efi and efi2
    + modify grub to use /boot/efi/EFI/grubenv as grubenv if mirror setup
    + keep EFI synced
+ FIXME: recovery-unmount.sh and bootstrap-2-chroot: reboot only working with --force

+ write logs of recovery,install,chroot,devop phase to /var/log/bootstrap-phase.log except recovery which writes to /boot/casper/bootstrap-recovery.log
+ print error before exit if download of recovery image fails
+ make replacement update-initramfs that mimics initramfs but calls dracut
+ add script to replace a changed faulty disk: recovery-replace-mirror.sh
+ add script to deactivate (invalidate) one of two disks: storage-invalidate-mirror.sh
+ make script bootstrap-1-restore and bootstrap-2-chroot-restore
+ recovery image: 18.04.02 is released, but ubuntu 18.04.02 live-server image does not work as 18.04.1
    + cloud-init error: running module set-passwords failed
    + other errors (systemd services failed), ssh not working
+ OPTIONAL: use tmux for long running ssh connections of bootstrap.sh

### devop stage
+ install and configure zfs auto snapshot and ZFS Scrubbing
+ make ~/downloads extra dataset with no backup and only few snapshots
+ install desktop, install language german with de_AT
    + configure evolution to use caldav, carddav
+ make backup working
+ make optional homesick configure if ./home exists (symlink to ~/.homesick/repos/$hostname)
+ think how to backport gnome 3.32 to bionic, or switch to disco and make 2 other hops until next lts
+ make repository data only available under a different group (not normally readable by user) and allow homeshick and others using a special command to operate on this file
